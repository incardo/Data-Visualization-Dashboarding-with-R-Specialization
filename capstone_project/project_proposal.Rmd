## Project Topic

Identify the subject of your project. What are you going to be making your visualizations about?

Some examples of possible topics:
* Educational achievement in a country/province/city
* Sports - player statistics and performance of a team
* Political survey data like what we've used in previous courses in this specialization
* Business data - prices, company performance, budget data, productivity data

Please indicate in as much detail as possible what the topic is going to be.

The scope of this project is to build an interactive dashboard using R-Shiny and flexdashboard.
The dashboard will present some advanced visualizations on a selection of World Bank's Development indicators. The main categories of indicators which will be covered are: Economy, Environment and People.The charts will try to shed some light
on the different environmental impact of each country and its main economic and social drivers

## Data Sources

Please identify the source(s) of data you will use for your project. Provide links to websites and citations for the data. Who created these data? How were they collected?

The World Development Indicators is a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. The database contains 1,400 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups, with data for many indicators going back more than 50 years.

## Description of the Data

Please provide specific details about your data.
 
* If the data covers a timespan, what is the time period?
* If the data covers a geographical location, what geographical location(s)?
* If the data is about a business, political, or non-governmental entity or activity, which entities or activities does it cover? For example is the data about economics, schools, politics, sports, or something else?
* What characteristics are captured by the data? For example, if your data is about cities, what characteristics of the cities are captured in the data? Population, crime rates, economic measures, business activity, traffic?
* Assuming your data is rectangular (like a spreadsheet), how many rows and columns are in the dataset? If your data is not rectangular, how are you going to create a "tidy" dataset from these data?

World Development Indicators is compiled by the World Bank and international partners. The database presents global economic conditions in six categories: World View, People, Environment, Economy, States and Markets, and Global Linkages. There are over 900 variables for 208 economies from 1960 to the present.

World Development Indicators provides measures of social progress, quality of life, economic development, physical infrastructure, environment and government performance.

The World Bank Data Catalogue provides access to related statistical series including; International Debt Statistics, Millennium Development Indicators, Education Statistics and Gender Statistics. Other World Bank research resources are introduced on this EUI Library page.


## Ideas about the figures that you will create to visualize this data:

Please provide ideas for the figures you are going to generate from these data. Are you going to make line plots, bar charts, density plot, dumbbell charts, choropleths, or what? You should provide a description of at least three figures. Your final project will include eight figures.

The project will include eigth figures:
1) choroplets
2) bar chart
3) animated map
4) line plots
5) scatter plot 
6) box plot
7) proportional area
8) sankey diagram
